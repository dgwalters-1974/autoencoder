# autoencoder
Detecting outliers with an autoencoder. Tabular dataset with multiple correlations and over 70 features was analysed for anomalous points as part of a project on financial data. The encoder was then used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset so that a visual representation can be explored in 2d and clusters within the structure of the data investigated - these plots can be seen in the Jupyter notebook files which are largely exploratory and unedited. '(anomaly_detector_all.ipynb' \ 'autoencoder_sf.ipynb').
The model uses the traditional encoder / decoder structure with anomalies being identified as points with the highest reconstruction error. The layers are structured (ix32)(32x4)(4x32)(32xi) where i is variable and dependent on the size of the input matrix of currencies. ReLU activation is used between layers and sigmoid activation for the final output. Model was run over 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001 and points that had o reconstruction error > 95th percentile were regarded as anomalies.
