# autoencoder
Detecting outliers with an autoencoder. Tabular dataset with multiple correlations and over 70 features was analysed for anomalous points as part of a project on financial data. The encoder was then used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset so that a visual representation can be explored in 2d and clusters within the structure of the data investigated.
